Problem : 
The marketing ops team sent over this spreadsheet containing four years of data from a CRM system (please make a copy of the spreadsheet in order to manipulate the data): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16hLtx8bBDe2GS1MOa3v9hY6Yhm4C30koLoCpiIJ5WDg/edit?usp=sharing.   The team wants to find the month they're likely to contact the most clients, so they can schedule a product upgrade announcement. Which month does the team tend to contact the greatest percentage of its clients?

Solution : 


1.  The spreadsheet is pretty small.So, I downloaded the copy of it on my laptop.
2.	Noticed thereâ€™s no null values, and the data is very clean. 
3.	Explored the data and found the there are 4 account Managers, 704 unique values in Date of contacts, 35 unique values in Client name. 
4.	To find out greatest percentage of clients appearing in a month I used Date of contact and Client name column in pivot table.

5.	To view it with more details, I used bar chart to have an overview idea of which month has how many clients appearing.

6.	Clearly, October has greatest percentage of clients appearing. So, I would choose the month October to schedule a product upgrade announcement.
